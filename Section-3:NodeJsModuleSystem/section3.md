- In this case , we need to declare the module first to create the file Eg: require ('fs')
- What node modle we want to load. 

- We need to install npm module 
```
npm install 
```
```
npm init 
```
```
npm install validator 
```

```
npm i chalk
```

- Challenge 2 : Define and use a function in a new file

 1. Create a new file called notes.js 
 2. Create a getNotes function that return your notes ...
 3. Export getNote funtion 
 4. From app.ks , load in and call the function printing the message to console . 

- Challenge 3 : Use the chalk library in your project 

 1. Install version 2.4.1 of Chalk 
 2. Load chalk into lecture-4.js
 3. Use it to print the string "Success !" to the console in green

- Bonus: Use docs to mess around with other styles. Make text bold and inversed.
